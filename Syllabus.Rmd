### UC-HBCU Summer Statistics Workshop
### W 2-5p
### PSYCH 1327

***

#### Instructor: Daniel Conroy-Beam
Email: dconroybeam@ucsb.edu

Office: Psych. East 2831

#### Graduate Assistant: Ashley Coventry
Email: ashleycoventry@ucsb.edu

<br>
The goal of this workshop is to cover the basics of analyzing data using R. We will cover the basics of programming in R as well as useful tools such as R Markdown and Github. We will then use R to practice the basics of data cleaning and processing, basic data analysis, data visualization, and some advanced techniques. At the end of the workshop, students will briefly present the results of their own data analysis project.

***

### Workshop Structure:

**Weekly meetings (required):** Dr. Conroy-Beam and students will meet weekly in person in Psych. 1326 on Wednesdays from 2-5p. Meetings will involve a mixture of lecture and interactive coding material. Time permitting, students can also work on their final data analysis project.

**Office hours (optional):** Dr. Conroy-Beam will hold weekly office hours in his office (Psych. East 2831) on Thursdays from 2-3p. All students are welcome to drop by. We can chat about anything: R, statistics, your final project, research, careers in psychologyâ€”whatever you like.

**Final presentations:** Students should work with their research mentor to find a dataset which they can use to complete their data analysis project. With the help of Dr. Conroy-Beam, Ashley, and/or their research mentors, students should (1) articulate a research question and (2) find a dataset that they can use to answer that research question. Students should then use R to clean and process that data as needed, conduct at least 1 inferential statistical test, generate at least 1 figure, generate a report that presents and describes these analyses, and make all of these materials accessible on GitHub. Students will share their research question and final report with the workshop on the final meeting day.

<br>
Outside these regularly scheduled meetings, both Dr. Conroy-Beam and Ashley will be available by email to help with questions or issues.
