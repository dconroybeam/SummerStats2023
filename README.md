Office: Psych. East 2831

#### Graduate Assistant: Ashley Coventry

Email: <ashleycoventry@ucsb.edu>

<br> The goal of this workshop is to cover the basics of analyzing data
using R. We will cover the basics of programming in R as well as useful
tools such as R Markdown and Github. We will then use R to practice the
basics of data cleaning and processing, basic data analysis, data
visualization, and some advanced techniques. At the end of the workshop,
students will briefly present the results of their own data analysis
project.

### Workshop Structure:

**Weekly meetings (required):** Dr. Conroy-Beam and students will meet
weekly in person in Psych. 1326 on Wednesdays from 2-5p. Meetings will
involve a mixture of lecture and interactive coding material. Time
permitting, students can also work on their final data analysis project.

**Office hours (optional):** Dr. Conroy-Beam will hold weekly office
hours in his office (Psych. East 2831) on Thursdays from 2-3p. All
students are welcome to drop by. We can chat about anything: R,
statistics, your final project, research, careers in psychology—whatever
you like.

**Final presentations:** Students should work with their research mentor
to find a dataset which they can use to complete their data analysis
project. With the help of Dr. Conroy-Beam, Ashley, and/or their research
mentors, students should (1) articulate a research question and (2) find
a dataset that they can use to answer that research question. Students
should then use R to clean and process that data as needed, conduct at
least 1 inferential statistical test, generate at least 1 figure,
generate a report that presents and describes these analyses, and make
all of these materials accessible on GitHub. Students will share their
research question and final report with the workshop on the final
meeting day.

<br> Outside these regularly scheduled meetings, both Dr. Conroy-Beam
and Ashley will be available by email to help with questions or issues.
